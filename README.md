# tfhe_bs_id
This is a toy example on how to implement the identity function with TFHE functional bootstrapping with tfhelib.
It helps to understand the effect of negacyclicity on the test polynomial coefficients.
If you want to try it, do not forget to change the path to the tfhelib in the Makefile.
